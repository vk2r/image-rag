| **What are AI Agents according to the document?** | AI Agents are described as **modular systems driven and enabled by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Information Models (LIMs)** for **task-specific automation**. They represent an evolution from earlier, rule-based systems and are positioned as a step beyond generative AI, advancing through **tool integration, prompt engineering, and reasoning enhancements**. Key characteristics include: Task-specific automation enabled by LLMs and LIMs. A shift from reactive or deliberative rule-based systems to learning-driven, context-aware architectures. Limited autonomy and adaptability in early systems (e.g., expert systems like MYCIN, DENDRAL, or rule-based systems like CLIPS), which relied on static knowledge bases and predefined logic. Modern AI Agents leverage **emergent neural architectures** to generalize across tasks and interact autonomously with unstructured, dynamic inputs. They operate in contrast to Agentic AI, which introduces greater autonomy, multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, and persistent memory. | **Respuesta muy precisa y completa** | **9/10** | Excelente alineación con el documento. Incluye definición correcta, características clave, evolución histórica y citas textuales apropiadas. Solo falta mayor énfasis en las tres características centrales específicas (autonomía, especificidad de tareas, reactividad/adaptación). |
| **What is meant by Agentic AI?** | **Agentic AI** refers to a paradigm shift in AI systems characterized by **multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, persistent memory, and coordinated autonomy**. Unlike traditional AI Agents, which are modular and task-specific, Agentic AI systems leverage deep learning, reinforcement learning, and foundation models to enable **contextual awareness, continuous learning, and emergent autonomy**. Agentic AI represents a more advanced and autonomous form of AI that can operate in dynamic, unstructured environments, adapt over time, and perform complex reasoning. It goes beyond simple prompt-based generation by incorporating mechanisms such as **ReAct loops, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), automation coordination layers, and causal modeling** to improve robustness, scalability, and explainability. The evolution from AI Agents to Agentic AI is marked by a transition from rule-based, reactive systems to learning-driven, flexible architectures. As noted in the document, the release of ChatGPT in 2022 catalyzed this shift, leading to a global surge in interest and development of autonomous systems capable of real-time reasoning and adaptive control. | **Respuesta excelente y muy completa** | **10/10** | Definición perfectamente alineada con el documento.
